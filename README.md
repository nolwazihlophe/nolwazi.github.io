## About me
 
I am the **Deputy Director: Financial Regulation and Supervision** with <a href="https://digitalfrontiers.org" target="_bank">Digital Frontiers</a> and I have recently been recognized by <a href="https://africanshapers.com/en/60-african-women-experts-in-fintech/" target="_bank">African Shapers</a> as one of the Top 60 African Women who are Fintech Experts. I obtained my MCom in Economics from the University of Pretoria in 2016. I previously worked for <a href="https://cenfri.org" target="_bank">Cenfri</a> as a **Senior Researcher** within the Risk, Remittances and Integrity Program and the <a href="https://www.centralbank.org.sz" target="_bank">The Central Bank of eSwatini</a> as a **Macroprudential Analyst** from which I moved on to **Manage** the **CBE Intelligence Hub**, which managed the **Fintech Unit**, which was established in 2018. 

I have experience and knowledge of payment systems, macroprudential and microprudential supervision as well as the use of financial regulation tools towards increased gender and financial inclusion.

I have a great passion for **capacity building**, which I firmly believe contributes to financial sector authorities making policy or regulatory reforms that are agile and enable **innovative financial systems** whilst maintain their **monetary and financial stability** mandate. My research interests include financial sector policymaking, regulation and supervision, financial and gender inclusion, innovation, data governance, data privacy and cybersecurity especially as we are moving into digitalization at an accelerated rate.
